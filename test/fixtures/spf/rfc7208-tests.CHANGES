  ! Added new test 'two-spaces' to test for proper treatment of records with
    more than one space between terms.
  ! Added new test 'trailing-space' to test that trailing spaces are ignored.
  ! Added new test 'ptr-case-change' to test inconsistent case from caching DNS
    servers, which has been common in the field recently.
  ! Added new test 'ptr-cname-loop' to test CNAME loops with inconsistent case
    in the name (so that a case sensitive compare with names already seen
    doesn't detect the loop).  Some think the loop should generate a permerror
    instead of skipping the name, but I documented the spec language to justify
    skipping.
--- 2014.05 (2014-05-16 05:00)
  ! Updates for RFC 7208 (4408bis)
    ! Updated multiple tests not to consider type SPF records under mixed
      conditions.  Note that due to the way the test suite is structured, many
      records are still labled SPF internally, but for test functions, it
      doesn't matter externally.
    ! Modified multiple tests to remove ambiguous results for cases that were
      ambiguous in RFC 4408, but have been clarified in RFC 7208.
    ! Changed "mx-limit" test to produce permerror result per changes in RFC
      7208.
    ! Added "void-over-limit", "void-at-limit", and "exp-void" tests for new
      void lookup limit.
  ! Added "invalid-trailing-macro-char" and "invalid-embedded-macro-char"
    tests from Stuart D. Gathman on pyspf trunk.
--- 2009.10 (2009-10-31 20:00)
  ! Added test case:
    ! "macro-multiple-delimiters":
      Multiple delimiters in a macro expression must be supported.
  * Fixed "multitxt2" test case failing with SPF-type-only implementations.
    Tolerate a "None" result to accomodate those.
--- 2008.08 (2008-08-17 16:00)
  ! "invalid-domain-empty-label", "invalid-domain-long",
    "invalid-domain-long-via-macro" test cases:
    A <target-name> that is a valid domain-spec per RFC 4408 but an invalid
    domain name per RFC 1035 (two successive dots or labels longer than 63
    characters) must be treated either as a "PermError" or as non-existent and
    thus a no-match.  (In particular, those cases can never cause a TempError
    because the error is guaranteed to reoccur given the same input data.
    This applies likewise to RFC-1035-invalid <target-name>s that are the
    result of macro expansion.)  Refined descriptions and comments to that
    end.
    The no-match behavior can be inferred by analogy from 4.3/1 and 5/10/3.
    The spec reference to 8.1/2 is bogus because the formal grammar does not
    preclude such invalid domain names.
  ! The "exp= without domain-spec" controversy has been resolved; it must be a
    syntax error.  Tightened "exp-empty-domain" test case accordingly.
  ! Added test cases:
    ! "a-dash-in-toplabel":
      <toplabel> may contain dashes.  Implementations matching <toplabel>
      non-greedily may get that wrong.
    ! "a-only-toplabel", "a-only-toplabel-trailing-dot":
      Both "a:museum" and "a:museum." are invalid syntax.  A bare top-label is
      insufficient, with or without a trailing dot.
    ! "exp-no-txt", "exp-dns-error":
      Clearly, "exp=" referring to a non-existent TXT RR, or the look-up
      resulting in a DNS error, must cause the "exp=" modifier to be ignored per
      6.2/4.
    ! "macro-mania-in-domain":
      Test macro-encoded percents (%%), spaces (%_), and URL-percent-encoded
      spaces (%20) in <domain-spec>.
    ! "macro-reverse-split-on-dash":
      Test transformation of macro expansion results: splitting on non-dot
      separator characters, reversal, number of right-hand parts to use.
  - Removed "a-valid-syntax-but-unqueryable" test case.  It is redundant to
    the "invalid-domain-empty-label" test case.
  - Relaxed "multispf1" test case:
    If performed via live DNS (yes, some people do that!), this test may be
    ineffective as DNS resolvers may combine multiple identical RRs.  Thus,
    tolerate the test failing in this manner.
  * Adjusted "multispf2" test case:
    Avoid combination of multiple identical RRs by using different
    capitalization in intentionally duplicate RRs.
  * Renamed test cases:
      a-numeric-top-label  ->  a-numeric-toplabel
      a-bad-toplab         ->  a-bad-toplabel
--- 2007.05 (2007-05-30 21:00)
  - "exp-empty-domain" test case is subject to controversy.  "exp=" with an
    empty domain-spec may be considered a syntax error or not, thus both "Fail"
    and "PermError" results are acceptable for now.
  * Renamed the old "exp-syntax-error" test case to "explanation-syntax-error"
    to indicate that it refers to syntax errors in the explanation string, not
    in the "exp=" modifier.
  ! Added test cases:
    ! "exp-syntax-error", "redirect-syntax-error":  Syntax errors in "exp=" and
      "redirect=" must be treated as such.
    ! "a-empty-domain", "mx-empty-domain", "ptr-empty-domain",
      "include-empty-domain", "redirect-empty-domain":  "a:", "mx:", "ptr:",
      "include:", and "redirect=" with an empty domain-spec are syntax errors.
    ! "include-cidr":  "include:<domain>/<cidr>" is a syntax error.
    ! "helo-not-fqdn", "helo-domain-literal", "domain-literal":  A non-FQDN
      HELO or MAIL FROM must result in a "None" result.
    ! "hello-domain-literal":  Macro expansion results must not be checked for
      syntax errors, but must rather be treated as non-matches if nonsensical.
    ! "false-a-limit":  There is no limit for the number of A records resulting
      from an "a:"-induced lookup, and no such limit must be imposed.
    ! "default-modifier-obsolete(2)":  The "default=" modifier used in very old
      spec drafts must be ignored by RFC 4408 implementations.
--- 2007.01 (2007-01-14 05:19)
  ! Added test cases:
    ! "nospftxttimeout":  If no SPF-type record is present and the TXT lookup
      times out, the result must either be "None" (preferred) or "TempError".
    ! "exp-multiple-txt", "exp-syntax-error":  Multiple explanation string TXT
      records and syntax errors in explanation strings must be ignored (i.e.,
      specifically "PermError" must NOT be returned).
    ! "exp-empty-domain":  "exp=" with an empty domain-spec is to be tolerated,
      i.e., ignored, too.  (This is under debate.)
    ! "exp-twice", "redirect-twice":  Added.  Multiple "exp=" or "redirect="
      modifiers are prohibited.
  * "Macro expansion rules" scenario:  Fixed a bug that caused TXT-only
    implementations to fail several tests incorrectly due to a real TXT record
    blocking the automatic synthesis of TXT records from the corresponding
    SPF-type records.
